create a ````terraform.tfvars```` filling the neccesary details following the structure in ````terrafrom.tfvars.example````


# Deployment

Ensure that you [aws configure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) with credentials that have the neccesary access policy. 

From the root of the project run:

1. To Provision infrastructure: ````make infra````

If you want to do both 1. and 2. in one go simply run ````make all````
